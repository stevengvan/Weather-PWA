# Weather PWA

A simple weather application made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and is built with Vite. It use Open-Meteo weather forecast and geocoding APIs to perform city lookups and retrieve the latest weather information of the city for the day and week. This project was meant to explore what Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are, how they work, and how well they perform compared to just a web app.
